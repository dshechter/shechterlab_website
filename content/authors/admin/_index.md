Originally from New York, David Shechter graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. (1995). He then worked with Dr. Michael O’Donnell at Cornell University Medical College and The Rockefeller University (New York City) studying DNA polymerases. He moved uptown to Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he earned a PhD with distinction (2004), working with Dr. Jean Gautier studying DNA replication, MCM helicases, and DNA damage checkpoints. David was a postdoctoral fellow at the Rockefeller University in Dr. David Allis’ laboratory, where he studied histone post-translational modifications. In 2009, David started his own laboratory in the Department of Biochemistry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He established a wide-ranging research program, using enzymology, structural biology, and biological studies to understand mechanisms of “writers” of epigenetic information. In addition to multiple NIH R01 awards and equipment supplements, he has received an Irma T. Hirschl Award, a Sinsheimer Award, The American Cancer Society-Robbie Sue Mudd Research Scholar Award, an SAS Foundation for Cancer Research Award, an American Lung Foundation Discovery Award, A Hirschl Career Award, and company sponsored research. He has multiple pending patents. David consults for companies interested in enzymes and chromatin regulatory factor drug development.
